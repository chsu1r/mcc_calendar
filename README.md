McCormick Calendar submission system to public mcc calendar.
- Allows residents/house gov members to submit events for approval by McCormick secretary. 
- Sends email response to event owner with approval/reasons why not approved.
- Sheet displays state of each event submission.
- Avoids having to give McCormick calendar public edit access. Only secretary should be able to manage events. All residents with the link can view events and add calendar.

Usage
- Residents fill out form.
- Secretary goes and looks at the Google Sheet with form responses.
- There's a column with dropdown menus with states - "Already added", "Not added","APPROVE", and "NOT APPROVE"
	- "Already added" and "Not added" refer to whether the event was approved or not approved by the secretary.
	- "APPROVE" and "NOT APPROVE" should be used for new event submissions (or event submissions that were previously not approved)

- My idea was that if a previously unapproved event had some changes to be resubmitted, then the secretary would just manually change the relevant entries in the sheet and then APPROVE the event.
- Emails are only sent once after the first approval/disapproval.
